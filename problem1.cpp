 * #########################   PROBLEM 1   ############################
 * 
 * In this problem you will be given a list of hockey teams and their
 * corresponding records. You must read the data from the given file,
 * and output the three best performing teams.
 *
 * The data is formatted in the following way:
 *
 *     City Name ShorthandName W-L-OTL
 *
 * Where W = wins, L = losses, and OTL = Overtime losses.
 *
 * A teams performance is based on the number of wins they have.
 * (We are simplifying here...) In the case of a tie, the team with
 * more OT losses will be ranked higher. In the case where wins and
 * OT losses are tied, teams should be ranked alphabetically.
 *
 * Output the full names and records of the top three performing teams
 * based on the criteria listed above.
